🛡 Demonstration of a Phishing Attack Using a Fake Instagram Login Page
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how phishing attacks are executed by creating a fake Instagram login page that captures user credentials. The goal is to educate users about how phishing works and how to identify and avoid such attacks.

🎯 Objective

To simulate a realistic phishing scenario for educational and awareness purposes.

To show how attackers design fake login pages to steal credentials.

To promote cybersecurity best practices and safe browsing habits.

🔧 Tools & Technologies

HTML & CSS – UI design for the fake Instagram login page.

PHP – Captures and stores entered credentials.

XAMPP – Local server environment (Apache + PHP).

VS Code / Notepad++ – Code editing.

Web Browser – For testing and demonstration.

⚙️ How It Works

A fake Instagram-like login page is displayed to the user.

When credentials are entered, PHP captures the input.

The data is stored in a local file named log.txt.

User is redirected to an image or a fake warning page, simulating a compromised account scenario.

🛡 Prevention & Awareness Tips

Always verify the URL before entering credentials.

Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).

Avoid clicking unknown or suspicious links.

Use browser phishing protection and reliable antivirus tools.

Check for HTTPS and valid security certificates.
